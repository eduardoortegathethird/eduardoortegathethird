Hope everyone is being a good citizen of the internet.

My name is Eduardo Ortega - I am a current PhD student focusing on hardware security. 

All projects associated in my git repo's are from previous coursework and current ongoing projects (academic and just for fun!).

If anyone wants to know my current research endeavours, I have a private repo just for that and would love to discuss with anyone interested.
