Hope everyone is being a good citizen of the internet.

My name is Eduardo Ortega - I am a current PhD student focusing on scalable, resilient edge computing, i.e., memory security, anomaly detection, and silicon lifecycle management. 

All projects associated in my git repo's are from previous coursework and current ongoing projects (academic and just for fun!).
